SystemVerilog
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/svstuff/systemverilog.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/svstuff/systemverilog)

Parser for SystemVerilog 2012. Can be used for e.g. checking the style against a coding standard.

Disclaimer
----------

This is very much a work-in-progress, and it is entirely possible that it will eat your testbench and melt your hard drive.

Ok, that's not very likely, but it will probably fail to parse valid systemverilog for lots of real code bases. That said,
it does work for the examples I have access to.

Status
